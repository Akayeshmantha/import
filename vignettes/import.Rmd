The import package
===================

## Introduction
One of the most important aspects of the R ecosystem is the ease with which
extensions and new features can be developed and distributed in the form of
*packages.* The main distribution channel is through the *Comprehensive R
Archive Network*, from which packages can be installed directly from within
R. Another popular option is using GitHub repositories from which packages can
also be painlessly installed, e.g. using `install_github` from the 
`devtools` package. 

The most common way to include functionality provided by a package is to use
the `library` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(PackageA)
library(PackageB)

value1 <- function_a(...) # Supposedly this comes from PackageA, 
value2 <- function_b(...) # and this from PackageB, but who knows?!
...
```

In some situations this is fine; however there are some subtle shortcomings:

1. Packages are *attached* and all of their exported objects are exposed,
2. When using more packages this way, the *order* in which they are included 
   can be important,
3. It quickly becomes *unclear* to the reader of a script what functionality
   comes from which package, and
4. the terms "library" and "package" are often used incorrectly 
   (although a minor point, it seems to confuse somewhat).

The problem with (1) is that the search path is populated with more
objects than are needed and it is not immediately clear whether name clashes
will occur. Problem (2) refers to the case where packages export
different objects with the same names, say if `function_b` is exported in both
`PackageA` and `PackageB` above. In this case the name will 
point to the object from the package included *last*. The earlier exposed 
objects are said to *masked*. Even if this is not a problem
when *writing* the script, an update of packages may cause this problem
later on when *executing* the script; and tracking down the resulting 
errors may be tough and time consuming. Problem (3) may appear unimportant, 
but it is not to be underestimated. Code snippets are very commonly shared
and spending time figuring out where functionality comes from is not 
a very satisfying nor value-adding activity.

To overcome the above, one may import single exported objects, one at a time, 
using the (double) "colon syntax",

```{r, eval = FALSE}
function_a <- PackageA::function_a
function_b <- PackageB::function_b
```

or functions can be prefixed with `::` when used, but this is often 
overly verbose and does not provide an easily accessible overview of what
external functionality is used in a script.

While packages form the backbone of code distribution, another option comes
in the form of *scripts*, but these are usually task specific and not
commonly used to "bundle" functionality for use in *other* scripts. In 
particular, when `source` is used to include contents from one script in 
another, once again *all* objects produced by the script will be "exposed"
and may "over populate" the working environment, masking other objects, 
if not only producing some mental clutter.

The `import` package sets out to improve the way external functionality 
is *included* in your code by alleviating some of the concerns raised above by
providing an expressive way of importing object from both packages and
scripts. The latter provides a bridge between the *package* approach to
distribtion and simple stand-alone scripts. This allows for the use of scripts
as *modules*, a collection og related object definitions, each of which
may be used at different places without exposing more than necessary.

## Usage
The `import` package itself is not to be attached 
(don't include it via `library`, you will get a warning). Rather, it is designed
to be expressive when using the colon syntax. A first pseudo-example is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
import::from(magrittr, "%>%")
import::from(dplyr, mutate, keep_when = filter)
import::from(tidyr, spread)
import::from(broom, tidy)

ready_data <-
  raw_data %>% 
  mutate(var2 = fun(var1)) %>% 
  keep_when(var1 > 0) %>% 
  spread(key, value) 

linear_model <- 
  lm(var1 ~ ., data = ready_data) %>% 
  tidy
  
# ... and more code below.
```

In the above, it is clear *which* package provides *which* functions
(one could e.g. otherwise be tempted to think that `tidy` belonged to
`tidyr`). Note that ordering is irrelevant, even if `tidyr` at some point
exposes a function `tidy` after an update, as `import` is *explicit* about
importing.

It also shows that one can import multiple objects in a single
statement, and even rename objects if desired; for example, in the above 
one can imagine that `filter` from `stats` is needed later on, and so
`dplyr`'s `filter` is renamed to avoid confusion. Sometimes, it is 
not at all clear what purpose a package has; e.g. the name `magrittr` does
not immediately reveal that it's main purpose is to provide the pipe 
operator, `%>%`.

When `import::from` is used to import objects it will place these in an 
environment attached in the search path under the name "imports". This 
name is just default, and can be specified:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
import::from(dplyr, mutate, select, .into = "wrangling")

# or equivalently:
import::into("wrangling", mutate, select, .from = dplyr)

ls("wrangling") # Also viewable in Rstudio's environment browser!
# => [1] "mutate" "select"
```

Note, that the `.from` and `.into` arguments are prefixed by a dot to
clearly distinguish them from other named arguments. The two 
alternatives above are equivalent (the choice is a matter of preferece).

If it is desired to import objects directly into the current environment, 
this can be accomplished by `import::here`. This is particularly 
useful when importing inside a function definition, or module scripts as
described below.
