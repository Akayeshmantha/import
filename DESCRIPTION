Description: The package provides an alternative mechanism for importing
  objects from packages. The syntax allows for importing mulitple objects
  from a package with a single command in an expressive way. The import
  package bridges some of the gap between using library (or require) and
  direct (single-object) import. Furthermore the imported objects are not
  placed in the current workspace.
